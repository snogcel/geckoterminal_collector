### 1. TASK_1 (System Documenation) ######################
# Document most important functions in system, as well as CLI architecture
# Review all documentation and organize it into a single unified resource (too scattered right now)

New CLI commands available:
  • gecko-cli add-watchlist --pool-id <id> --symbol <sym> [--name <name>] [--network-address <addr>] [--active true/false]
  • gecko-cli list-watchlist [--active-only] [--format table/csv/json]
  • gecko-cli update-watchlist --pool-id <id> [--symbol <sym>] [--name <name>] [--network-address <addr>] [--active true/false]
  • gecko-cli remove-watchlist --pool-id <id> [--force]

###################################


### 2. TASK_2 (QA Testing) ################################################
## Work on Updated Test Scripts for system data workflow (QA)
## Review other bugs noted in previous QA iteration for any other data flows within the system to consider (logging, etc)

The comprehensive test will show you:

Whether new pools are being collected properly
If history records are being created and stored
Signal analysis functionality and data quality
Watchlist integration and auto-addition
Database performance and potential bottlenecks
Overall system health and any configuration issues

The debug script will specifically help with the "weird bugs" you mentioned by:

Analyzing data patterns and anomalies
Checking for collection gaps or timing issues
Validating signal analysis calculations
Identifying database performance problems
Showing pool lifecycle tracking issues
Run these scripts and they'll give you detailed insights into what's working and what needs attention in your new_pools_history data capture process!

Collection Issues: Missing data, gaps in collection, frequency problems
Data Quality Problems: Null values, anomalous data, validation failures
Signal Analysis Issues: Missing signal scores, trend calculation problems
Performance Issues: Slow queries, missing indexes
Database Structure: Table schema, indexes, constraints

Database Migration
✅ Successfully added 6 new signal analysis fields to new_pools_history
✅ Created optimized indexes for signal queries
✅ Zero data loss during migration

Signal Analysis Engine
✅ NewPoolsSignalAnalyzer working perfectly
✅ 5 signal components: volume, liquidity, momentum, activity, volatility
✅ Weighted scoring system (0-100)
✅ Auto-watchlist integration

Enhanced Data Collection
✅ NewPoolsCollector enhanced with signal analysis
✅ Increased collection frequency (30m → 10m)
✅ Real-time signal calculation and storage
✅ Auto-watchlist functionality

## Testing Notes:

🐛 Remaining Issues:
1. Unicode Encoding Error
'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f40b' in position 89: character maps to <undefined>
This is happening because some pool names contain Unicode characters (emojis, special characters). This is a Windows-specific encoding issue.

2. SQL Text Wrapping
Still need to fix the remaining SQL queries that aren't wrapped with text().






Key Findings:
✅ What's Working Well:
Table Structure: The new_pools_history table exists with all 33 columns and proper indexes
Data Collection: You have 632 records collected, showing the system is working
Data Quality: No missing critical fields (pool_id, volume, liquidity, etc.)

⚠️ Issues Identified:
Collection Gaps: Missing data for several hours (17:00-19:00, 21:00-22:00 on 2025-09-16)
No Recent Data: 0 records in the last 6 hours - collection may have stopped
Single-Hour Pools: All pools (100%) are only tracked for 1 hour, suggesting they're not being re-collected
Signal Analysis Issue: Division by zero error in signal analysis (likely due to no recent data)

🔍 Root Cause Analysis:
The "weird bugs" you mentioned are likely related to:

Collection Scheduling: The collector isn't running consistently (gaps in collection)
- Pool Re-tracking: Pools are only captured once instead of being monitored over time
- Signal Analysis: Failing due to insufficient data for calculations

❌ The Bug:
The error is clear: 'signal_score' is an invalid keyword argument for NewPoolsHistory

This means there's a mismatch between:

The NewPoolsHistory database model (which has the signal_score column as we saw in the debug output)
The NewPoolsHistory Python model class (which doesn't accept signal_score as a parameter)

✅ Major Improvements:
Database Connection: Working perfectly
Recent History Records: Now showing 499 records (vs 0 before)
Database Performance: Query performance is excellent (0.01s for 100 records)
Watchlist Integration: Working well

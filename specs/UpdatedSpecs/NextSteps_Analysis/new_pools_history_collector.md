## TODO -- Concept Idea 

Based on my analysis, I can see that you already have a solid foundation for new pools data collection, but there are several key requirements to implement regular data capture for the new_pools_history table to create signals on new DEX pools. Here's what would be required:

Current State Analysis
✅ What's Already Working:

NewPoolsCollector is implemented and functional
NewPoolsHistory database model exists with comprehensive fields
Basic scheduling is configured (30-minute intervals for Solana)
CLI commands exist for manual collection
Database storage methods are implemented
❌ What Needs Enhancement:

Requirements for Regular Data Capture
1. Enhanced Scheduling & Automation
Currently, the system has basic 30-minute intervals, but for signal generation you'll need:

# Enhanced config.yaml
new_pools:
  networks:
    solana:
      enabled: true
      interval: "15m"  # More frequent for better signal detection
      signal_analysis: true
      auto_watchlist_integration: true

2. Signal Detection Logic
You'll need to implement signal analysis on the collected data:

class NewPoolsSignalAnalyzer:
    """Analyze new pools history for trading signals."""
    
    def analyze_pool_signals(self, pool_history: List[NewPoolsHistory]) -> Dict:
        """Generate signals from pool history data."""
        signals = {
            'volume_spike': self._detect_volume_spike(pool_history),
            'liquidity_growth': self._detect_liquidity_growth(pool_history),
            'price_momentum': self._detect_price_momentum(pool_history),
            'activity_surge': self._detect_activity_surge(pool_history)
        }
        return signals

3. Data Aggregation & Trend Analysis
Regular data capture needs aggregation for meaningful signals:

# Add to database manager
async def get_pool_trend_data(self, pool_id: str, hours: int = 24) -> List[Dict]:
    """Get trending data for signal analysis."""
    
async def calculate_pool_momentum(self, pool_id: str) -> Dict:
    """Calculate momentum indicators from history."""

4. Enhanced CLI Commands for Signal Analysis
# New commands needed:
gecko-cli analyze-new-pools-signals --network solana --hours 24
gecko-cli monitor-pool-signals --pool-id solana_ABC123 --alert-threshold 0.8
gecko-cli export-signals --format json --output signals.json

5. Real-time Monitoring & Alerts
class PoolSignalMonitor:
    """Monitor pools for signal conditions."""
    
    async def check_signal_conditions(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """Check all monitored pools for signal conditions."""
        
    async def send_alerts(self, signals: List[Dict]) -> None:
        """Send alerts for detected signals."""

Implementation Steps
Phase 1: Enhanced Data Collection (Immediate)
Increase Collection Frequency

Change interval from 30m to 15m or 10m
Add burst collection during high-activity periods
Add Signal-Specific Fields

# Enhance NewPoolsHistory model
signal_score = Column(Numeric(10, 4))
momentum_indicator = Column(Numeric(10, 4))
volume_trend = Column(String(20))  # 'increasing', 'decreasing', 'stable'
Implement Trend Calculation

async def calculate_pool_trends(self, pool_data: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Calculate trends for signal generation."""
    # Compare current data with historical averages
    # Calculate momentum, volatility, activity scores

Phase 2: Signal Analysis Engine (Next)
Create Signal Detection Algorithms

Volume spike detection (>200% increase)
Liquidity growth patterns
Price momentum indicators
Trading activity surges
Add Signal Scoring System

def calculate_signal_strength(self, pool_data: Dict, history: List) -> float:
    """Calculate overall signal strength (0-100)."""
Phase 3: Integration & Automation (Final)
Auto-Watchlist Integration

Automatically add high-signal pools to watchlist
Set collection priorities based on signal strength
Real-time Monitoring Dashboard

Live signal updates
Alert system for strong signals
Historical signal performance tracking
Quick Start Implementation
To get started immediately, you could:

Modify the existing collector to run more frequently:

# Edit config.yaml
new_pools:
  networks:
    solana:
      interval: "10m"  # Increase frequency
Add basic signal detection to the existing collector:

# In NewPoolsCollector._create_history_record()
signal_score = self._calculate_basic_signal_score(pool_data)
history_record['signal_score'] = signal_score
Create analysis queries to identify patterns:

-- Find pools with increasing volume trends
SELECT pool_id, AVG(volume_usd_h24) as avg_volume
FROM new_pools_history 
WHERE collected_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY pool_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4
ORDER BY avg_volume DESC;

The foundation is solid - you mainly need to enhance the analysis layer and increase collection frequency to generate meaningful signals from the new pools data.

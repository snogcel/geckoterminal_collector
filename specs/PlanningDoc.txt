# Planning (TODAY)


TODO (Business Tasks)

1. Address Prefix Technical Debt







1. New Pools History Collection

2. QA / Test Coverage

3. QLib Server



















TODO (Personal Tasks)

- Takeaways from UPW Refresh (Breakthrough 2022 V2)
- 25 active daily users of easyonset.com? (Currently Seems Unrealistic)
- Find additional ways to create flow state (programming does it for me)

# PROCESS

1. Analyze the actual root issue.

2. Still need to finish test coverage. Technical debt and all that stuff.

Technical debt refers to the future costs incurred when developers take shortcuts or make suboptimal decisions for short-term gains, like meeting a deadline. Similar to financial debt, this "debt" accumulates interest over time, manifesting as increased development effort, higher maintenance costs, slower progress, and reduced code quality. While not inherently bad, unmanaged technical debt can significantly hinder a software system's ability to evolve and adapt to new requirements

3. QLib Server

# END PROCESS







###################################






#################################### Big Picture:


# Scheduler Completed (almost)
python examples/cli_with_scheduler.py run-once (start works, just bugs)

# Test Coverage...

# gecko_terminal_collector for backfilling data





# qlib for generating features
# QLib or QLib-Server first?

# dexscreener for scraping rankings

# trade address tagger for entry / exit signals

# trade execution
- might sell data, but never this architecture.

# Thinking Zone #####

Maybe just integrate QLib into gecko_terminal_collector\utils\statistics_engine

Review:

  - Create database statistics collection functions for pools and history record counts
  - Implement network and DEX distribution analysis functions
  - Create recent records retrieval with proper formatting and filtering
  - Add collection activity timeline tracking for the last 24 hours

Catch data quality issues on system load?

ohlcv_collector.py:665-676 

            # Check for extreme price movements (potential data quality issues)
            if open_price > 0 and close_price > 0:
                price_change_ratio = abs(close_price - open_price) / open_price
                if price_change_ratio > 10:  # 1000% change
                    validation_errors.append(f"Extreme price movement: {price_change_ratio:.2%}")
            
            # Check for extremely high volume relative to price
            if open_price > 0 and volume_usd > (open_price * 1000000):  # Volume > 1M times price

I find that, over time, I've adapted to Anxiety feeling more like Adrenaline - that reshaping makes it much easier to handle social anxiety.





Do many people have the ability to think without using words to describe their thought process? It's hard to describe, especially in writing lmao.
- Abstract Thought when reviewing difficult tasks.

I've noticed that uncompleted tasks just linger in my brain until they are completed. It's great (definitely not virtuous) in certain ways, but kind of hides things from me.

So grateful for a quiet environment to gather my thoughts.

listening to songs from the year 2007, and just reflecting how self-centered the world is these days that it could possibly be construed to relate to current events. Fucking ridiculous.

"You should probably get that checked out" - said my Mom as she slowly died of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, wayyyyy back in 2005.

Feels like my opinions have been instantly discounted my entire fucking life. I made a decision a few days ago to fight off a summer cold, and here we are asgain. The third day of being sick.

# listening to songs from the year 2007, and just reflecting how self-centered the world is these days that it could possibly be construed to relate to current events. Fucking ridiculous.

"You should probably get that checked out" -- decision making involves making a decision (three days ago), to fight off what was formerly known as a summer cold. It sucks, but so does life sometimes.

"Much too much"



If I ask you for the antonym of the word "fragile," what would you say? Maybe something strong, robust... well, actually, it’s not quite like that.

The opposite is Antifragile. But what's the difference?

The term "anti-fragile" was coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2012 book Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder. Taleb, a statistician, risk analyst, and former trader, developed the concept while studying systems that not only withstand stress and volatility but actually benefit from them.

Taleb introduced the term to describe a category of systems that thrive and grow stronger when exposed to uncertainty and chaos. He observed that traditional categories of fragility and robustness were insufficient to explain how certain entities react positively to stressors.

The idea came from Taleb's extensive work in risk management and his observations of financial markets, biological systems, and technological innovations. He noted that while some things break (fragile) and others endure (robust), some entities actually improve and evolve in response to stress.

Taleb constructed the term by adding the prefix "anti-" to "fragile," explicitly creating a word that conveys the opposite of fragility. Unlike "robust" or "resilient," which suggest resistance to damage, "anti-fragile" indicates a system that gains from disruptions.

    Fragility: Breaks under stress (e.g., glass).

    Robustness: Resists stress but doesn’t improve (e.g., steel).

    Anti-Fragility: Improves with stress (e.g., muscle growth from exercise).

Hope you learned something new today. ;)

##### Personal Journals:				
			
Thinking back....


"The request "Dashify Bitcore" refers to configuring a Bitcore-based application to work with the Dash cryptocurrency
. The term "dashify" is not a standard procedure but rather a descriptive way of referring to the process of adapting a Bitcore project for the Dash network. 
Bitcore is a software stack and framework for Bitcoin and its derivatives that allows developers to build blockchain applications. In contrast, Dashcore is the specific fork of this framework developed by the Dash project. 
Here is how you would "Dashify" a Bitcore application:

    Use the Dash-specific Bitcore library. Instead of the general Bitcore library, you must use bitcore-dash or dashcore-lib, which is maintained by the Dash community. This version includes all the necessary configurations and functionalities for interacting with the Dash blockchain.
    Point to the Dash network. When initializing your application, you must configure it to connect to the Dash network. Dashcore nodes automatically download and interface with Dash Core.
    Utilize Dash-specific features. If your application uses specialized Dash features like InstantSend, ChainLocks, or masternodes, you will use the specific extensions and APIs provided by bitcore-dash. For example, the bitcore-wallet-client-dash library connects to the Dash wallet service for creating and managing wallets.
    Reference Dash network data. If you are building a block explorer or a service that reads blockchain data, you will interact with the Dash Insight API, which provides access to Dash-specific data points. 

The dashcore-node project is a prime example of a "dashified" Bitcore application, providing a fully functional Dash node for building custom applications"




Bitcore is a suite of tools for building Bitcoin and blockchain-based applications, originally created by BitPay
. While it functions as an extensible full node, its core principles focus on modularity, robust infrastructure, and developer-centric tools to interface with the Bitcoin network. 
The core principles of Bitcore for a Node.js environment are:

    Modularity: The project is broken down into separate npm modules, allowing developers to include only the necessary functionality for their application. This provides flexibility and keeps the project lightweight. Key modules include bitcore-lib (core Bitcoin features), bitcore-p2p (peer-to-peer networking), and bitcore-node (the full node functionality).
    Reliable API: Bitcore provides a stable and powerful JavaScript API for interacting with the Bitcoin protocol. This allows developers to work with high-level functions for creating and managing transactions, addresses, and keys, abstracting away the low-level complexities of the Bitcoin protocol.
    Full Node Capabilities: A Bitcore Node.js instance can run a full Bitcoin node, including the C++ code from Bitcoin Core. This means it can independently validate every transaction and block against the Bitcoin consensus rules, giving developers access to verified blockchain data without relying on a third-party API.
    Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Interaction: The bitcore-p2p module enables Node.js applications to communicate directly with the Bitcoin network. This allows for the broadcasting of transactions and the syncing of blockchain data, enhancing an application's resilience and decentralization.
    Developer Empowerment: The project is designed to lower the barrier to entry for Bitcoin development. By providing a comprehensive set of JavaScript tools and libraries, Bitcore allows developers to build robust applications and services like wallets, block explorers, and payment processors.
    Decentralization and Trust-Minimization: By allowing applications to run a full node and directly query blockchain data, Bitcore minimizes the need to trust external, centralized services. This aligns with Bitcoin's core principle of decentralization and provides a more secure, resilient infrastructure for applications.
    Performance: A Bitcore node can offer significant performance advantages over relying on third-party JSON-RPC APIs. The direct, native access to blockchain data provides a much faster and more efficient way for services to access network informatio


Ahhh I think back to when I ported this entire stack from Bitcoin to Dash.

# takeaway -- define logic issue with software, then delegate to Kiro.

Hey Kiro, can you help me troubleshoot this problem? When I run the following command:

python examples/cli_with_scheduler.py run-once -col historical_ohlcv

I see that the job_id for "collector_ohlcv_collector" doesn't get registered, and as a result it defaults to a default configuration.

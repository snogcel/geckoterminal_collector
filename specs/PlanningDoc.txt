# Self Centered Development Approaches - until September 28th ############################################################################


I've noticed that the recommended approach for adding new watchlist entries doesn't work. What are your recommendations on how to fix this?

(c:\Projects\geckoterminal_collector\.conda) C:\Projects\geckoterminal_collector>python -m gecko_terminal_collector.cli add-watchlist --pool-id "solana_mkoTBcJtnBSndA86mexkJu8c9aPjjSSNgkXCoBAtmAm" --symbol "YUGE"

I can see the issue! The add-watchlist command doesn't exist in the main CLI. Let me check what commands are actually available and then help you implement the missing functionality.

Read file(s)

cli.py
I can see the issue! The main CLI doesn't have an add-watchlist command. Let me check if there's a separate example or utility for adding watchlist entries:

Read file(s)

test_add_watchlist.py
I can see the issue! The add-watchlist command doesn't exist in the main CLI. Let me create a proper solution by adding this command to the CLI. Let me first check the current CLI structure and then add the missing functionality.

Searched workspace
Looking for watchlist-related functionality in the CLI
Now let me check if there's a WatchlistProcessor or similar utility that handles adding watchlist entries:

Searched workspace
Looking for watchlist processor or manager files
Searched workspace
Looking for watchlist-related Python files
Searched workspace
Looking for watchlist processor or manager classes
Perfect! Now I can see there's a WatchlistProcessor class. Let me check it and also look at the database models to understand how to properly add watchlist entries:

Read file(s)

watchlist_processor.py 130 - 161

models.py 130 - 161
Now let me check the full WatchlistProcessor to understand how it works:

Read file(s)

watchlist_processor.py
Now I understand the issue! The system expects watchlist entries to be managed through CSV files, but there's no CLI command to add entries to the database directly. Let me create a proper solution by adding the missing add-watchlist command to the CLI.

Read file(s)

cli.py 2500 - 9007199254740992
Now let me add the add-watchlist command to the CLI. I'll need to add it to the subparsers and create the command handler:

Now let me add the command parser function and the command handler:

Now let me add the command handler function at the end of the file, before the if __name__ == "__main__": line:

Now let me check if the database manager has the store_watchlist_entry and get_watchlist_entries methods:

Searched workspace
Checking if the database manager has watchlist methods
I can see there are two different signatures for store_watchlist_entry. Let me check the SQLAlchemy manager to see the correct signature:

Read file(s)

sqlalchemy_manager.py 1390 - 1421
Let me also check if there's a get_watchlist_entries method:

Searched workspace
Looking for get_watchlist_entries method
I need to check what watchlist methods are available:

Searched workspace
Looking for all watchlist methods in the database manager
Perfect! I can see there are multiple methods available. Let me update the command to use the correct method and also add a method to get all watchlist entries. Let me first check if there's a method to get all entries:

Searched workspace
Looking for methods to get all watchlist entries
I'll need to create a simple query to count watchlist entries. Let me update the command to use the correct method:

Now let's test the new command:

(c:\Projects\geckoterminal_collector\.conda) C:\Projects\geckoterminal_collector
I see the issue! There's a foreign key constraint error because the pool doesn't exist in the pools table yet. The watchlist entry references a pool that must exist first. Let me check the database schema:

Read file(s)

models.py 134 - 156
The issue is that the pool_id has a foreign key constraint to the pools.id table, but the pool doesn't exist yet. I need to modify the command to either:

Create the pool first, or
Make the foreign key constraint optional
Let me check how other parts of the system handle this. Let me look at how the watchlist collector works:

Searched workspace
Looking at how the watchlist collector handles adding entries
Let me check how the watchlist monitor handles this - it seems to successfully add entries. Let me look at that code:

Read file(s)

watchlist_monitor.py 270 - 291
I see that the watchlist monitor uses record.pool_address directly, not a prefixed pool ID. Let me check what format the pool addresses are in the CSV files:

Read file(s)

watchlist.csv
I see! The CSV uses raw pool addresses without network prefixes, but the database expects prefixed pool IDs. The issue is that I need to either:

Create the pool entry first, or
Use the raw address format
Let me check if there's a method to create a basic pool entry. But first, let me see if the system is designed to work with raw addresses. Let me check the database to see what pool IDs actually exist:

Perfect! So the pool IDs in the database do have the solana_ prefix. The issue is that when I try to add a watchlist entry, the pool with that ID doesn't exist yet.

The solution is to modify the command to either:

Create a basic pool entry first, or
Allow the user to add watchlist entries that will be resolved later when the pool is discovered
Let me check how the system is supposed to work. Let me look at the watchlist collector to see how it handles this:

Read file(s)

watchlist_collector.py 250 - 281
Let me look at the broader context of how the watchlist collector works:

Read file(s)

watchlist_collector.py 200 - 251
I see the issue! The watchlist collector calls _create_or_update_watchlist_entry AFTER it has collected the pool data and presumably created the pool entry. The pool must exist before the watchlist entry can be created.

Let me modify the CLI command to create a basic pool entry first. Let me check how pools are created:

Searched workspace
Looking for how pools are created in the database
Perfect! There's a store_pool method. Let me check the Pool model to see what fields are required:

Read file(s)

models.py 30 - 81
I can see that the Pool model requires:

id (primary key)
address (not null)
dex_id (foreign key to dexes table, not null)
So I need to create a basic pool entry with these required fields. Let me modify the CLI command to create a minimal pool entry first:

# PROCESS

1. Analyze the actual root issue.

2. Still need to finish test coverage. Technical debt and all that stuff.

Technical debt refers to the future costs incurred when developers take shortcuts or make suboptimal decisions for short-term gains, like meeting a deadline. Similar to financial debt, this "debt" accumulates interest over time, manifesting as increased development effort, higher maintenance costs, slower progress, and reduced code quality. While not inherently bad, unmanaged technical debt can significantly hinder a software system's ability to evolve and adapt to new requirements

3. QLib Server

I've noticed that uncompleted tasks just linger in my brain until they are completed. It's great (definitely not virtuous) in certain ways, but kind of hides things from me.

So grateful for a quiet environment to gather my thoughts.

"You should probably get that checked out" - said my Mom as she slowly died of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, wayyyyy back in 2005.

Feels like my opinions have been instantly discounted my entire fucking life. I made a decision a few days ago to fight off a summer cold, and here we are asgain. The third day of being sick.

# listening to songs from the year 2007, and just reflecting how self-centered the world is these days that it could possibly be construed to relate to current events. Fucking ridiculous.

"You should probably get that checked out" -- decision making involves making a decision (three days ago), to fight off what was formerly known as a summer cold. It sucks, but so does life sometimes.

"Much too much"



If I ask you for the antonym of the word "fragile," what would you say? Maybe something strong, robust... well, actually, it’s not quite like that.

The opposite is Antifragile. But what's the difference?

The term "anti-fragile" was coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2012 book Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder. Taleb, a statistician, risk analyst, and former trader, developed the concept while studying systems that not only withstand stress and volatility but actually benefit from them.

Taleb introduced the term to describe a category of systems that thrive and grow stronger when exposed to uncertainty and chaos. He observed that traditional categories of fragility and robustness were insufficient to explain how certain entities react positively to stressors.

The idea came from Taleb's extensive work in risk management and his observations of financial markets, biological systems, and technological innovations. He noted that while some things break (fragile) and others endure (robust), some entities actually improve and evolve in response to stress.

Taleb constructed the term by adding the prefix "anti-" to "fragile," explicitly creating a word that conveys the opposite of fragility. Unlike "robust" or "resilient," which suggest resistance to damage, "anti-fragile" indicates a system that gains from disruptions.

    Fragility: Breaks under stress (e.g., glass).

    Robustness: Resists stress but doesn’t improve (e.g., steel).

    Anti-Fragility: Improves with stress (e.g., muscle growth from exercise).

Hope you learned something new today. ;)

##### Personal Journals:				
			
Thinking back....


"The request "Dashify Bitcore" refers to configuring a Bitcore-based application to work with the Dash cryptocurrency
. The term "dashify" is not a standard procedure but rather a descriptive way of referring to the process of adapting a Bitcore project for the Dash network. 
Bitcore is a software stack and framework for Bitcoin and its derivatives that allows developers to build blockchain applications. In contrast, Dashcore is the specific fork of this framework developed by the Dash project. 
Here is how you would "Dashify" a Bitcore application:

    Use the Dash-specific Bitcore library. Instead of the general Bitcore library, you must use bitcore-dash or dashcore-lib, which is maintained by the Dash community. This version includes all the necessary configurations and functionalities for interacting with the Dash blockchain.
    Point to the Dash network. When initializing your application, you must configure it to connect to the Dash network. Dashcore nodes automatically download and interface with Dash Core.
    Utilize Dash-specific features. If your application uses specialized Dash features like InstantSend, ChainLocks, or masternodes, you will use the specific extensions and APIs provided by bitcore-dash. For example, the bitcore-wallet-client-dash library connects to the Dash wallet service for creating and managing wallets.
    Reference Dash network data. If you are building a block explorer or a service that reads blockchain data, you will interact with the Dash Insight API, which provides access to Dash-specific data points. 

The dashcore-node project is a prime example of a "dashified" Bitcore application, providing a fully functional Dash node for building custom applications"




Bitcore is a suite of tools for building Bitcoin and blockchain-based applications, originally created by BitPay
. While it functions as an extensible full node, its core principles focus on modularity, robust infrastructure, and developer-centric tools to interface with the Bitcoin network. 
The core principles of Bitcore for a Node.js environment are:

    Modularity: The project is broken down into separate npm modules, allowing developers to include only the necessary functionality for their application. This provides flexibility and keeps the project lightweight. Key modules include bitcore-lib (core Bitcoin features), bitcore-p2p (peer-to-peer networking), and bitcore-node (the full node functionality).
    Reliable API: Bitcore provides a stable and powerful JavaScript API for interacting with the Bitcoin protocol. This allows developers to work with high-level functions for creating and managing transactions, addresses, and keys, abstracting away the low-level complexities of the Bitcoin protocol.
    Full Node Capabilities: A Bitcore Node.js instance can run a full Bitcoin node, including the C++ code from Bitcoin Core. This means it can independently validate every transaction and block against the Bitcoin consensus rules, giving developers access to verified blockchain data without relying on a third-party API.
    Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Interaction: The bitcore-p2p module enables Node.js applications to communicate directly with the Bitcoin network. This allows for the broadcasting of transactions and the syncing of blockchain data, enhancing an application's resilience and decentralization.
    Developer Empowerment: The project is designed to lower the barrier to entry for Bitcoin development. By providing a comprehensive set of JavaScript tools and libraries, Bitcore allows developers to build robust applications and services like wallets, block explorers, and payment processors.
    Decentralization and Trust-Minimization: By allowing applications to run a full node and directly query blockchain data, Bitcore minimizes the need to trust external, centralized services. This aligns with Bitcoin's core principle of decentralization and provides a more secure, resilient infrastructure for applications.
    Performance: A Bitcore node can offer significant performance advantages over relying on third-party JSON-RPC APIs. The direct, native access to blockchain data provides a much faster and more efficient way for services to access network informatio


Ahhh I think back to when I ported this entire stack from Bitcoin to Dash.

# takeaway -- define logic issue with software, then delegate to Kiro.

Hey Kiro, can you help me troubleshoot this problem? When I run the following command:

python examples/cli_with_scheduler.py run-once -col historical_ohlcv

I see that the job_id for "collector_ohlcv_collector" doesn't get registered, and as a result it defaults to a default configuration.

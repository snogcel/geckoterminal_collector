- Add error handling and recovery
- Validate system stability

**Tasks:**
1. **Create PerformanceMonitor** class
2. **Add comprehensive logging** and metrics collection
3. **Implement error handling** for all components
4. **Test system recovery** from various failure scenarios
5. **Create monitoring dashboard** or reporting

**Success Criteria:**
- All metrics being collected accurately
- Error handling prevents system crashes
- Recovery mechanisms working
- Performance monitoring operational
- System stability validated over 24+ hours

#### Day 12-14: Integration Testing & Validation
**Objectives:**
- Comprehensive system testing
- Performance validation against existing system
- Documentation and handoff preparation

**Tasks:**
1. **Run comprehensive integration tests**
2. **Compare performance** with your existing backtesting results
3. **Validate Sharpe ratio** and other key metrics
4. **Test edge cases** and error scenarios
5. **Document results** and create handoff materials

**Success Criteria:**
- All integration tests passing
- Performance within 10% of existing system
- Sharpe ratio comparable to 1.327 target
- Edge cases handled gracefully
- Complete documentation available

## Resource Requirements

### Development Environment
- Python 3.8+ with NautilusTrader dependencies
- Access to your existing PostgreSQL database
- Binance testnet account for paper trading
- Your existing `macro_features.pkl` data files

### Testing Infrastructure
- Extend your existing test framework (95% success rate)
- Use your existing database test patterns
- Leverage your working QLib integration tests
- Add NautilusTrader-specific test cases

### Monitoring & Validation
- Extend your existing performance monitoring
- Use your existing technical indicators as validation
- Compare against your existing signal analysis results
- Maintain your existing test coverage standards

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Data synchronization issues**: Mitigated by using your existing data pipeline
- **Performance degradation**: Monitored against your existing benchmarks
- **Integration complexity**: Reduced by building on proven infrastructure

### Trading Risks
- **Paper trading only**: No real capital at risk during POC
- **Position sizing validation**: Compared against your existing calculations
- **Signal interpretation**: Validated against your existing system

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope creep**: Controlled by focusing on core functionality first
- **Technical blockers**: Mitigated by fallback to existing system
- **Performance issues**: Addressed through incremental optimization

This roadmap leverages your existing infrastructure and proven components while systematically adding NautilusTrader capabilities, ensuring a successful POC within the 2-week timeframe.

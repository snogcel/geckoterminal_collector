Kiro:
Now I understand the issue! Here's what's happening:

The CLI registers the collector with ID "historical_ohlcv"
The scheduler calls collector.get_collection_key() which returns "historical_ohlcv_collector"
The scheduler creates a job_id as f"collector_{collector_key}" = "collector_historical_ohlcv_collector"
But the CLI is looking for "collector_historical_ohlcv" (without the _collector suffix)
The problem is in the CLI's collector matching logic. Let me fix this by updating the CLI to handle the correct collector keys:

Perfect! The fix worked! ðŸŽ‰

The command now successfully finds and runs the historical OHLCV collector. I can see from the output:

The collector was found: "Found exact match: 'historical_ohlcv_collector'"
It's running correctly: The collector is making API requests and collecting historical data
Rate limiting is working: It hit a 429 rate limit, which shows the rate limiting system is functioning

Summary of the fix:
The issue was in the collector matching logic in the CLI. The problem was:

CLI was looking for collector name "historical_ohlcv"
But the actual collector key was "historical_ohlcv_collector" (with _collector suffix)
The job_id was "collector_historical_ohlcv_collector"
I fixed the matching logic to handle these naming variations by:

Exact matching: Now checks if the input matches the collector key directly OR if adding _collector to the input matches the collector key
Partial matching: Enhanced to also check if removing _collector from the collector key matches the input
The fix handles these collector name patterns:

historical_ohlcv â†’ matches historical_ohlcv_collector
ohlcv â†’ matches ohlcv_collector
trade â†’ matches trade_collector
etc.
Now you can use either the short name (historical_ohlcv) or the full name (historical_ohlcv_collector) and it will work correctly!

To configure the interval, you still need to modify the config.yaml file or use environment variables as I mentioned earlier, since the CLI uses the configured intervals rather than accepting them as command-line parameters.

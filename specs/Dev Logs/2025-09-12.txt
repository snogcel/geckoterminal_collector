# Task 5:

âš  Historical collection had issues: ["Error collecting historical data for pool 7bqJG2ZdMKbEkgSmfuqNVBvqEvWavgL8UEo33ZqdL3NP: 'HistoricalOHLCVCollector' object has no attribute '_collect_pool_timeframe_data'"]

This is failing because the lookup by id requires a prefix "solana_"

in this case, that prefix is not included in the response I am looking at currently.

# noticed that solana is hard coded everywhere, just going with it.

# Database Concurrency & Recovery Analysis - September 15, 2025

## Overview
Analysis of real-world database locking issues and system recovery mechanisms observed during production operation, providing valuable insights into system resilience and areas for improvement.

## üîç Issue Analysis

### Root Cause: SQLite Database Locking
**Primary Issue**: `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`

**Technical Details**:
- **Error Location**: SQLAlchemy autoflush during query execution
- **Affected Operations**: Pool updates (`UPDATE pools SET last_updated=?`)
- **Trigger**: Multiple concurrent collectors accessing the same database
- **Duration**: Persistent locking for ~30+ seconds per operation

### Timeline Analysis

#### Phase 1: Initial Lock Detection (06:46:01)
```
06:46:01 - top_pools_solana collector starts
06:46:34 - First database lock error detected
06:46:34 - Error propagates through collection chain
```

#### Phase 2: Consecutive Failures (06:46 - 07:07)
```
Failure 1: 06:46:34 - Consecutive errors: 1
Failure 2: 06:52:07 - Consecutive errors: 2  
Failure 3: 06:57:07 - Consecutive errors: 3
Failure 4: 07:02:07 - Consecutive errors: 4
Failure 5: 07:07:08 - Consecutive errors: 5
```

#### Phase 3: Automatic Recovery (07:07:41)
```
07:07:41 - Error recovery triggered after 5 consecutive failures
07:07:41 - Collector disabled automatically
07:08:41 - Collector re-enabled after 1-minute cooldown
07:08:41 - Recovery completed
```

## üéØ System Resilience Observations

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well

#### 1. **Automatic Error Detection**
- System correctly identified consecutive failures
- Proper error counting and threshold management
- Clear logging of failure progression

#### 2. **Graceful Recovery Mechanism**
- **Threshold**: 5 consecutive errors triggers recovery
- **Cooldown Period**: 1-minute disable/re-enable cycle
- **Automatic Restart**: No manual intervention required

#### 3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
- Critical alerts generated at failure threshold
- Unhealthy collector detection working
- Comprehensive error logging with stack traces

#### 4. **Service Isolation**
- Other collectors (new_pools_solana, trade_collector) continued operating
- Database locks didn't cascade to entire system
- Partial service degradation vs. complete failure

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

#### 1. **Database Concurrency Management**
**Current Issue**: SQLite locking under concurrent access
```sql
-- Problematic pattern observed:
UPDATE pools SET last_updated=? WHERE pools.id = ?
-- Multiple collectors trying to update same records simultaneously
```

**Recommendations**:
- Implement connection pooling with proper timeout handling
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Consider WAL mode for SQLite or migrate to PostgreSQL
- Implement database-level locking strategies

#### 2. **Session Management**
**Current Issue**: SQLAlchemy autoflush causing premature commits
```python
# Error suggests autoflush issues:
# "consider using a session.no_autoflush block if this flush is occurring prematurely"
```

**Recommendations**:
- Implement explicit session management
- Use `session.no_autoflush` blocks for read operations
- Batch write operations to reduce lock contention
- Implement proper transaction boundaries

#### 3. **Recovery Time Optimization**
**Current Behavior**: 5 failures √ó 5-minute intervals = 25 minutes downtime
**Impact**: Extended service degradation before recovery

**Recommendations**:
- Implement exponential backoff for faster detection
- Add circuit breaker pattern for immediate failure detection
- Reduce recovery threshold for database-specific errors
- Implement health checks between scheduled runs

## üîß Proposed Solutions

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

#### 1. **Enhanced Database Manager**
```python
class ImprovedSQLAlchemyManager:
    def __init__(self, config):
        # Enable WAL mode for better concurrency
        self.engine = create_engine(
            config.database.url,
            connect_args={
                "timeout": 30,
                "check_same_thread": False
            },
            pool_pre_ping=True,
            pool_recycle=3600
        )
        
    async def store_pools_with_retry(self, pools, max_retries=3):
        """Store pools with exponential backoff retry logic."""
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            try:
                return await self._store_pools_internal(pools)
            except OperationalError as e:
                if "database is locked" in str(e) and attempt < max_retries - 1:
                    wait_time = (2 ** attempt) * 0.5  # 0.5, 1, 2 seconds
                    await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
                    continue
                raise
```

#### 2. **Session Management Enhancement**
```python
async def store_pools(self, pool_records):
    """Enhanced pool storage with proper session management."""
    with self.connection.get_session() as session:
        try:
            # Disable autoflush for read operations
            with session.no_autoflush:
                # Perform all reads first
                existing_pools = self._check_existing_pools(session, pool_records)
            
            # Batch write operations
            new_pools = []
            updates = []
            
            for pool in pool_records:
                if pool.id in existing_pools:
                    updates.append(pool)
                else:
                    new_pools.append(pool)
            
            # Execute in batches to reduce lock time
            if new_pools:
                session.bulk_insert_mappings(Pool, [p.__dict__ for p in new_pools])
            
            if updates:
                session.bulk_update_mappings(Pool, [p.__dict__ for p in updates])
            
            session.commit()
            
        except Exception as e:
            session.rollback()
            raise
```

#### 3. **Circuit Breaker Implementation**
```python
class DatabaseCircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=3, recovery_timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    
    async def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.recovery_timeout:
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError("Database circuit breaker is OPEN")
        
        try:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            self._on_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._on_failure()
            raise
    
    def _on_success(self):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.state = "CLOSED"
    
    def _on_failure(self):
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.last_failure_time = time.time()
        
        if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
            self.state = "OPEN"
```

### Medium-Term Improvements

#### 1. **Database Migration Strategy**
- **Option A**: SQLite WAL Mode + Connection Pooling
- **Option B**: PostgreSQL Migration for better concurrency
- **Option C**: Hybrid approach with read replicas

#### 2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
```python
class DatabaseHealthMonitor:
    async def check_database_health(self):
        """Comprehensive database health check."""
        metrics = {
            "connection_pool_size": self.get_pool_size(),
            "active_connections": self.get_active_connections(),
            "lock_wait_time": await self.measure_lock_wait_time(),
            "query_performance": await self.measure_query_performance()
        }
        return metrics
```

#### 3. **Adaptive Collection Scheduling**
```python
class AdaptiveScheduler:
    def adjust_collection_intervals(self, collector_health):
        """Dynamically adjust collection intervals based on system health."""
        if collector_health["database_locks"] > 0.1:  # 10% lock rate
            # Increase intervals to reduce contention
            self.increase_interval(collector_health["collector_id"], factor=1.5)
        elif collector_health["success_rate"] > 0.95:  # 95% success
            # Decrease intervals for better data freshness
            self.decrease_interval(collector_health["collector_id"], factor=0.9)
```

# Task 11: Comprehensive Error Handling and Resilience Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive error handling and resilience framework for the GeckoTerminal collector system. This implementation provides robust error classification, intelligent recovery strategies, circuit breaker patterns, structured logging, health monitoring, and graceful shutdown capabilities.

## Sub-task 11.1: Robust Error Handling Framework

### Components Implemented

- **Error Categories**: Network, API rate limit, client errors, data validation, database, configuration, authentication, timeout, resource exhaustion
- **Recovery Actions**: Retry immediate, retry with backoff, retry with circuit breaker, skip and continue, fail fast, escalate, reset connection, reduce load
- **Severity Levels**: Low, medium, high, critical
- **Default Classifications**: Pre-configured rules for common error types (ConnectionError, TimeoutError, HTTP status codes, etc.)

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handler (`gecko_terminal_collector/utils/error_handling.py`)
- **Intelligent Retry Logic**: Uses error classification to determine optimal retry strategy

#### 4. Graceful Shutdown (`gecko_terminal_collector/utils/resilience.py`)
- **GracefulShutdownHandler**: Signal handling for clean shutdown
- **Shutdown Callbacks**: Registered cleanup functions
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of database connections, file handles, etc.
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable shutdown timeout with forced termination

#### 5. System Manager (`gecko_terminal_collector/utils/system_manager.py`)
- **SystemManager**: Complete system lifecycle management
- **Initialization Order**: Proper component initialization sequence
- **Background Services**: Automatic startup of monitoring and maintenance services
- **Status Reporting**: Comprehensive system status with component health

### Key Features

# Configure retry behavior
retry_config = RetryConfig(max_retries=3, base_delay=1.0, backoff_factor=2.0)
error_handler = ErrorHandler(retry_config)

# Execute with intelligent retry
result = await error_handler.with_retry(
    api_call_function,
    context="fetch_pool_data",
    circuit_breaker_name="api_client",
    collector_type="pool_collector"
)
```

### Health Monitoring
```python
from gecko_terminal_collector.monitoring.health_endpoints import SystemHealthEndpoints

health_endpoints = SystemHealthEndpoints(db_manager=db, api_client=client)

# Get comprehensive health status
health_status = await health_endpoints.get_health_status()

# Check readiness for load balancer
readiness = await health_endpoints.get_readiness_status()
```

### Structured Logging
```python
from gecko_terminal_collector.utils.structured_logging import get_logger, LogContext

# Create contextual logger
context = LogContext(collector_type="ohlcv_collector", pool_id="pool_123")
logger = get_logger(__name__, context)

# Log with automatic context inclusion
logger.info("Starting OHLCV collection", extra={"timeframe": "1h"})

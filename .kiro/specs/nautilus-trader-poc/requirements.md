# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for building a 2-week proof of concept (POC) that integrates our Q50-centric quantile trading system with NautilusTrader and PumpSwap DEX execution. The POC will validate the technical feasibility, performance characteristics, and implementation complexity of using NautilusTrader as our primary trading platform with real Solana DEX execution capabilities before committing to full production implementation.

The POC aims to demonstrate that our existing Q50 system (which achieves a 1.327 Sharpe ratio) can be successfully integrated with NautilusTrader while maintaining performance quality and providing a foundation for future scalability including RD-Agent integration and multi-asset expansion. This integration extends beyond paper trading to include actual DEX execution via PumpSwap SDK.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Q50 Signal Integration with NautilusTrader

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want to integrate our existing Q50 quantile predictions with NautilusTrader, so that I can execute systematic trades based on our proven signal generation system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL successfully load our existing Q50 signals from `data3/macro_features.pkl`
2. WHEN Q50 signals are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate that required columns (q10, q50, q90, vol_raw, vol_risk, prob_up, economically_significant, high_quality, tradeable) are present
3. WHEN a new market data tick arrives THEN the system SHALL retrieve the corresponding Q50 signal for that timestamp
4. IF no exact timestamp match exists THEN the system SHALL use the most recent available signal within a 5-minute window
5. WHEN Q50 signals are processed THEN the system SHALL convert quantile predictions to actionable trading decisions using our regime-aware probability conversion logic
6. WHEN signals are processed THEN the system SHALL apply our variance-based regime identification (vol_risk as variance measure) for enhanced risk assessment
7. WHEN integrating with NautilusTrader THEN the system SHALL inherit from NautilusTrader's Strategy base class and process quote ticks appropriately

### Requirement 2: PumpSwap DEX Integration for Trade Execution

2. WHEN Q50 signal strength is available THEN the system SHALL use signal_strength = `abs_q50 * min(enhanced_info_ratio / effective_info_ratio_threshold, 2.0)`
3. WHEN vol_risk (variance measure) is available THEN the system SHALL apply variance regime adjustments using vol_risk.quantile(0.30), vol_risk.quantile(0.70), and vol_risk.quantile(0.90)
4. WHEN calculating final position size THEN the system SHALL validate against PumpSwap pool liquidity using `get_pool_data()` response
5. WHEN pool liquidity is insufficient THEN the system SHALL reduce position size to maximum feasible amount or skip trade
6. WHEN position size exceeds 50% of pool liquidity THEN the system SHALL cap position to 25% of pool liquidity to minimize price impact
7. WHEN final position size is calculated THEN the system SHALL clip position_size_suggestion to range [0.01, 0.5] (1%-50% of capital)

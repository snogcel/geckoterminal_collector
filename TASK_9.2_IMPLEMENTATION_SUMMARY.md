    ExecutionHistoryTracker, MetricsCollector, CollectionMonitor
)

# Initialize monitoring components
execution_history = ExecutionHistoryTracker()
metrics_collector = MetricsCollector()
monitor = CollectionMonitor(execution_history, metrics_collector)

# Add alert handler
def alert_handler(alert):
    print(f"Alert: {alert.level.value} - {alert.message}")

monitor.add_alert_handler(alert_handler)
```

### Scheduler Integration
```python
from gecko_terminal_collector.scheduling import CollectionScheduler
from gecko_terminal_collector.monitoring.database_manager import MonitoringDatabaseManager

# Create scheduler with monitoring
scheduler = CollectionScheduler(
    config=config,
    monitoring_db_manager=MonitoringDatabaseManager(session_factory)
)

# Get comprehensive monitoring status
status = scheduler.get_monitoring_status()
```

### Performance Analysis
```python
# Get performance metrics
metrics = scheduler.get_performance_metrics()

# Get execution history
history = scheduler.get_execution_history(
    collector_type="pool_collector",
